#### ToDo-Panda

T3JS framework based implementation of "todo" app.


#### Project dependencies:

- RequireJS
- doT.JS
- T3JS

#### Project Description:

This is an augmented version of todoMVC in T3JS using **requireJS** as module loader, doT.js as template engine, and with a fresh look and feel. I have also stripped down the actual router code to listen for **hashchange** event.

I personally experienced that T3JS is good for small to medium scale web interfaces built on *principles of progressive web apps*, otherwise, it feels like too much when there are many moving parts in an interface. I would use this framework when not building a SPA or a page with multiple dynamic parts.
